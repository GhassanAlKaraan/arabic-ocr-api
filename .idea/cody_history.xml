                <text value="Here is an explanation of the selected Python code:&#10;&#10;The `if __name__ == '__main__'` block is used to execute code only when the file is run directly, and not when it is imported as a module in another file. &#10;&#10;`__name__` is a special built-in variable in Python that evaluates to the name of the current module. When a file is run directly, `__name__` is set to `'__main__'`. But when a file is imported as a module in another file, `__name__` is set to the name of that module.&#10;&#10;So this `if` block allows you to put code that you only want to run when the file is executed directly under it. It prevents that code from running if the file is imported elsewhere.&#10;&#10;Inside the `if` block is:&#10;&#10;`print_hi('PyCharm')`&#10;&#10;This calls a function called `print_hi` and passes the string 'PyCharm' to it. &#10;&#10;So in summary, this code will call the `print_hi` function, passing 'PyCharm' to it, but only when the file is executed directly. The `print_hi` function would be defined elsewhere in the code. This allows you to easily add code you only want to run when the file is used directly and not imported." />
